We appreciate new contributors, to contribute we decided to use the "fork-and-pull" git worklow:
1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Commit changes to your own branch
4. Push your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a pull request so that we can review your changes
