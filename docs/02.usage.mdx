# Usage

## Create
To init a resource-loader just create a new instance of the resource loader class:
```javascript
const resourceLoader = new ResourceLoader();
```

This will search your whole body for resource components and load all the resources defined on them.

## Resource Components
By setting the `data-resources` attribute on any html tag you can create a resource component which will be acknowledged by the resource loader:
```html
<div data-resources="[]"></div>
```

To know what data should go in there look at the [API documentation](/api)
